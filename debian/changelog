flare (0.14.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disabling the override of dh_fixperms at the moment, it doesn't
    seem to work on buildd machines.  Better a lintian warning that
    not being able to build in all architectures...

flare (0.14.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Simplifying debian/rules by using specific flags controlling the
    directories to use for building.
  * Fixing in debian/rules the way to remove executable permissions to
    a PNG file, so it doesn't break on buildd machines (it was working
    fine in pbuilder, though).
  * Disabled the automatic re-generation of the single man page, the
    man page is already provided in its proper form and can be
    regenerated from time to time -- no need for the added complexity
    of overriding dh_installman in debian/rules.  As a consequence,
    remove the xsltproc and docbook-* build-deps (XML is not being
    used for anything else).
