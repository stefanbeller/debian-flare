flare (0.15.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Jan-Hendrik Peters <hennr@hennr.name> ]
  * New upstream release (Closes: #646455)
    - Imported Upstream version 0.15.1 [76cb190]
  * Added new build dependency: libsdl-ttf2.0-dev

  [ Manuel A. Fernandez Montecelo <manuel.montezelo@gmail.com> ]
  * Remove stuff in debian/ now present upstream:
    - flare.desktop (now in distribution/flare.desktop.in)
    - flare-icon.png (installed by CMake from art_src/logo/flare_logo.svg), and
      debian/source/include-binaries (created because of this icon)
  * debian/rules:
    - No need for "override_dh_fixperms" with this upstream
    - Now it doesn't contain the master CMakeLists.txt on build, so no need for
      overrides to "dh_auto_configure", "dh_auto_build" or "dh_auto_clean"
      (already commented out); nor "--builddirectory=build" to the base "dh"
      template.
  * debian/copyright: minor updates, e.g. changes to dir names and clarifying
    that files are under GPLv3/CC-BY-SAv3 or later (not just 3.0)
  * Update package descriptions (text taken from upstream's README)

flare (0.14.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Installing .desktop file in the proper directory, otherwise it doesn't work
  * Quell lintian warnings:
    - latest-debian-changelog-entry-without-new-date: fix date of entry for
      version 0.14.1-3, it was set to one hour too early and didn't notice any
      lintian warning before uploading
    - duplicate-short-description: Improving description of packages flare and
      flare-data

flare (0.14.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disabling the override of dh_fixperms at the moment, it doesn't
    seem to work on buildd machines.  Better a lintian warning that
    not being able to build in all architectures...

flare (0.14.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Simplifying debian/rules by using specific flags controlling the
    directories to use for building.
  * Fixing in debian/rules the way to remove executable permissions to
    a PNG file, so it doesn't break on buildd machines (it was working
    fine in pbuilder, though).
  * Disabled the automatic re-generation of the single man page, the
    man page is already provided in its proper form and can be
    regenerated from time to time -- no need for the added complexity
    of overriding dh_installman in debian/rules.  As a consequence,
    remove the xsltproc and docbook-* build-deps (XML is not being
    used for anything else).
