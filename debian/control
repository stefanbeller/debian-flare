Description: FOSS single-player 2D action RPG engine
 Flare is not a reimplementation of an existing game or engine.
 It is a tribute to and exploration of the action RPG genre.
 .
 Rather than building a very abstract, robust game engine, the goal of
 this project is to build several real games and harvest an engine from
  the common, reusable code. The first game, in progress, is a 
  fantasy dungeon crawl.
 .
 Flare uses simple file formats (INI style config files) for most of the
  game data, allowing anyone to easily modify game contents.
  Open formats are preferred (png, ogg).
  The game code is C++ and is released under the GPL v3;
  the game art is CC-BY-SA 3.0
