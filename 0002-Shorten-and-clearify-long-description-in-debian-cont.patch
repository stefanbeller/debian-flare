-Description: FOSS single-player 2D action RPG engine
- Flare is not a reimplementation of an existing game or engine.
- It is a tribute to and exploration of the action RPG genre.
- .
- Rather than building a very abstract, robust game engine, the goal of
- this project is to build several real games and harvest an engine from
-  the common, reusable code. The first game, in progress, is a 
-  fantasy dungeon crawl.
- .
- Flare uses simple file formats (INI style config files) for most of the
-  game data, allowing anyone to easily modify game contents.
-  Open formats are preferred (png, ogg).
-  The game code is C++ and is released under the GPL v3;
-  the game art is CC-BY-SA 3.0
+Description: single-player 2D action role-play game

+ Diablo.
